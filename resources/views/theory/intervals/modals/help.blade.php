<p>Each round shows an interval name (like M3 or P5) and gives you a starting note on either the treble or bass clef. Tap the staff to place your note, drag it to adjust, and use sharps/flats/naturals when needed. Hit Check to see if you got it right, earn points (with a bonus for first-try answers), and continue through the set.</p>
