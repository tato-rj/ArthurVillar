<p>Each round shows an interval name (like M3 or P5) and gives you a starting note on the staff.</p>
<p>You have to add a new note, above or below, following the indicated interval.</p>

<h6>How to add a note?</h6>
<p class="mb-5"><strong>Tap</strong> the staff to place your note and <strong>drag</strong> it to adjust.</p>

<h6>How do I add accidentals?</h6>
<p class="mb-5"><strong>Drag and drop</strong> sharps/flats/naturals on the note when needed. For double sharps or double flats, just drag and drop twice.</p>

<h6>What do I do if I’m stuck?</h6>
<p>If you make a mistake, a <strong>help button</strong> appears. Click it to see the answer. Ps: using help gives you no points for that round.</p>
